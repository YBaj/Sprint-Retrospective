# Sprint-Retrospective Yusuf Bajwa
Spring Review and Retrospective


How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program requires you to have a deeper understanding of what the needs are. If you understand what those needs are just as much as your user then you can break it down into smaller tasks and then truly implement them. Creating "user stories" is what helps you get a deeper understanding as it gets down into the specific details. If a client tells me they want more search functionality then that's left to my interpretation but if they submit a user story and say they want to search travel packages by destination and price then I can fully understand what they need from me. 

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

With anything in life it is important to take things step by step, and I believe with developing programs it is extremely important. If you break things down into small tasks you will not be overwhelmed as easily, and it will allow you to develop programs with increased ease. Some great agile processes, such as Stand-ups and retrospectives are something I would love to take with me in my future of development. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means doing a lot of things. You must be aware of others and what exactly is expected from you. You must be able to be accountable for your actions and hold others accountable for their actions. Most importantly, you must be able to communicate effectively and transparently. Being aware and having these traits will lead to a cohesion and guaranteed success between you and your fellow team members.
